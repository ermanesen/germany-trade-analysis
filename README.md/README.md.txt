# Junior Trade Data Analysis – Germany

## Overview
This project presents a junior-level data analysis of Germany’s trade balance
using publicly available World Bank data. The objective is to understand basic
trade balance dynamics and explore the relationship between trade performance
and macroeconomic growth.

## Data Sources
- World Bank – Exports of goods and services (% of GDP)
- World Bank – Imports of goods and services (% of GDP)
- World Bank – GDP growth (annual %)

## Methodology
The analysis follows a structured but introductory data analytics workflow:
- Data loading and cleaning
- Transformation of World Bank data into tidy format
- Calculation of trade balance
- Time-series visualization and crisis-period markers
- Correlation analysis between trade indicators
- Introductory OLS regression to examine the relationship between GDP growth and trade balance

The project intentionally focuses on fundamental analytical techniques rather
than advanced econometric modeling.

## Key Findings
- Germany exhibits a structurally positive trade balance over time.
- Major global shocks such as the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19
  pandemic caused temporary declines in trade surplus.
- GDP growth shows a meaningful relationship with trade balance, suggesting
  that macroeconomic conditions influence external trade performance.

## Tools
- Python (pandas, numpy)
- Data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)
- Basic econometric analysis (statsmodels)

## Outputs
- Time-series visualization of Germany’s trade balance

## Notes
This project is designed as a learning-focused, junior-level data analysis
exercise aimed at building a solid analytical foundation in international
trade and macroeconomic data analysis.
